Documentation on Encounters and Pokémon Typing can be found (here)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OszN1OpqSaCd1Xh4AFgchgvVfCOX5l2OIztPUgnbisU/edit?usp=sharing]

## What is special about this Rom Hack?

Pokémon Emerald Seaglass is a complete visual overhaul of Pokémon Emerald, converting the style of the overworld and Pokémon to a more retro, Gameboy-like style. In addition, all Pokémon from Generations 1-3 are catchable, evolutions from later generations were added, and various other changes have been made to make this a unique Emerald experience.

## FEATURES

- Complete visual overhaul, thanks to [Zaebucca](https://zaebucca.itch.io/)'s tiles!
    - Style resembles old 90's RPGs, like an upgraded Pokémon GSC style
    - Pokémon use GBC-style sprites, from Generation 2 and talented artists like [Egg](https://x.com/Egg3ggEgg)
    - Overworld NPCs have more retro artstyle, with a white outline to make them pop!
    - Upgraded Pokédex with many helpful new features, inspired by HGSS dex but in GBC style
- New additions to some maps to increase interesting events
    - Ex: Wishing Well in Rustboro City, Birdhouses in Fortree City, etc.
- All Pokémon from Generations 1-3 are available, spread out enough to keep it from feeling bloated!
    - Cross-gen evolutions have also been added, up to Gen 9!
    - Pokémon use modified USUM movesets when applicable
    - Almost all Pokémon have recieved some changes! From slight stat changes to new types, each Pokémon should feel more unique to use
    - Trainers use wider variety of Pokémon (Team Aqua and Magma fights are finally interesting!)
    - Additional available Pokémon: Spiky-Ear Pichu, Tinkaton line, and Applin line (details on obtaining in documentation)
- Party-wide EXP Share, with soft level caps to balance this change
    - This is *NOT* a "difficulty hack"! These changes just cut down on some grind while still keeping a good balance
    - Soft level cap allows for you to reach the gym leader's max, then halves exp gain for the next few levels, then cuts it more
- Battle Gimmick: Z-Power Ring and Z-Crystals can be obtained from the DEVON Corporation after delivering Steven's letter
    - Completely optional and out of the way - if you don't like Z-Moves, don't even bother getting the Z-Ring!
    - EXP. Share is given by Scott in Petalburg, just after Wally's catching tutorial
- More minigames to break up Pokémon battles!
    - SCUBA SAFARI, Pacifidlog Town: A combination of the Safari Zone and Bug Catching Contest from Johto, with 200 steps or 5 encounters in a dedicated underwater area to find a high-scoring Pokémon. Various helpful rewards are provided, including the HM Waterfall. Pacifidlog Town is also accessible from Slateport through an NPC with a Kirlia by the Pokémon Center after beating Team Aqua in the Museum.
    - PINBALL, Mauville Game Corner and Mossdeep Game Corner: Four unique pinball games (SEEL, GENGAR, MEOWTH, and DIGLETT) are in both Game Corners. Beating the games award PINBALL POINTs, which can be used to get rare Pokéballs, items, and even some Alolan forms!
    - The Contest Hall has been moved to Verdanturf Town, and the Verdanturf Battle Tent has been moved to Lilycove! This will let the player enter contests much earlier, hopefully engaging with them much more
- Various QoL Changes, including:
    - Type Effectiveness shown in battle
    - HM System revamp: if HM is in bag and the right badge is owned, Pokémon that can learn the HMs can naturally use them
    - Shiny odds 1/4096 by default, but Shiny Charm is in Player PC to increase odds (gives 5 extra rerolls!)
        - Second Shiny Charm, giving even more rerolls, available in Fortree City! Interact with all shrines from east to west in order, and the second Shiny Charm will be in the final shrine (left of the Pokémon Center)
    - Press R to toggle auto-run
    - Press A in Summary Screen to view IVs and EVs; All Pokémon have at least 2 perfect IV's
    - Legendaries can all be encountered, many before Elite Four - details in documentation
    - Pokémon Box Link, allowing access to PC from anywhere (obtained from Scientist NPC in Slateport City Pokémon Center)

## FUTURE PLANS

High Priority (Before Release 1.0):
- Mystery Gift Codes feature branch (rare candy cheat? MAKE A POLL)
- Change Brendan and May string names to Ethan and Lyra based on poll results
- Random nicknames option?

Later Additions (After Release 1.0):
- Make changes to Aqua/Magma dialogue!
    - Based on changes from ORAS
- Make Pokenews thing happen more often (Lilycove Dept. Store rooftop sales, Berry Blend master, etc)
- After Expansion 1.9.0 adds follower system, maybe revamp follower sprites to be in retro style to fit game?
- Day/Night system? Maybe with FakeRTC system using internal clock system?
- Look into music modding! Convert sound font to be more like gen 2?
    - Some RSE music in 8 bit style by Mixeli on youtube

## KNOWN BUGS & PROBLEMS

- Visuals Issues:
    - Battle Frontier buildings mostly use vanilla Emerald tiles, which don't match the aesthetic of the rest of the game
    - A few rare tile misalignments are possible, but should be rare
- Other issues:
    - Pinball physics are far from perfect, but tbh I think that adds to the charm lol
