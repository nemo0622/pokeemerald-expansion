# Pokémon Emerald Seaglass

Rom Hack based on Pokémon Emerald Expansion.

## What is special about this Rom Hack?

Pokémon Emerald Seaglass is a complete visual overhaul of Pokémon Emerald, converting the style of the overworld and Pokémon to a more retro, Gameboy-like style. In addition, all Pokémon from Generations 1-3 are catchable, evolutions from later generations were added, and various other changes have been made to make this a unique Emerald experience.

## FEATURES

- Complete visual overhaul, thanks to [Zaebucca](https://zaebucca.itch.io/)'s tiles!
    - Style resembles old 90's RPGs, like an upgraded Pokémon GSC style
    - Pokémon use GBC-style sprites, from Generation 2 and talented artists like [Egg](https://x.com/Egg3ggEgg)
    - Overworld NPCs have more retro artstyle, with a white outline to make them pop!
    - Upgraded Pokédex with many helpful new features, inspired by HGSS dex but in GBC style
- New additions to some maps to increase interesting events
    - Ex: Wishing Well in Rustboro City, Birdhouses in Fortree City, etc.
- Party-wide EXP Share, with soft level caps to balance this change
    - This is *NOT* a "difficulty hack"! These changes just cut down on some grind while still keeping a good balance
    - Soft level cap allows for you to reach 1 level above the gym leader's max, then halves exp gain for the next few levels, then cuts it more

## FUTURE PLANS

- Revamped encounters, allowing all Gen 1-3 Pokémon to be encountered
    - Also allow future evolutions
    - Consider adding a few more Pokémon from future generations (Tinkaton family? + more with unique type combos)
- Buff certain old Pokémon to make them all fun to use
    - Not all need to be like "competitive" lol - Water/Fire Octillery, Ground/Flying Dodrio, etc.
- Add data for GSC Beta Pokémon - can be easter eggs in the game, given by secret NPCs after quests?
- Convert scripts to PoryScript and code extra events
    - Events: Rustboro City Wishing Well, Fortree City Birdhouses, etc. (plus add a few more easter eggs!)
    - Add some more NPCs across the overworld, with gift eggs and fun tidbits
- Purchase [Arex's Tiles](https://arex-v.itch.io/fantasy), using new tiles to increase map variety
- Convert all Pokémon icons to GBC style
- Add more general QOL features where necessary
- After Expansion 1.9.0 adds follower system, maybe revamp follower sprites to be in retro style to fit game?
- Day/Night system? Maybe with FakeRTC system using internal clock system?

## KNOWN BUGS & PROBLEMS

- Some tiles may misalign - a few cave tiles and Fallarbor trees, but nothing major
