SHIT TO ADD INTO THIS PATCH
FEATURE BRANCH STUFF:
- Egg Move tutor: https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Make-Move-Relearner-Teach-Egg-Moves-With-A-Flag

- Use printf debugging to see if dexnav is at least properly tracking what direction hunted Pokemon is in

I know this is a lot, but it's probably the last big patch so
