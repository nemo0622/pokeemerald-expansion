MAJOR FEATURE CHANGES:
- Open Pokédex page for Pokémon from Party Menu! (Credit to RavePossum for the help!)
	- Allows quick info about movesets, stats, etc.
- Match Calls no longer happen while DexNav is active
- Many new GBC-style item icons by _glados11388!
	- Ongoing process, many items still in GBA style, but still a good step

BALANCE CHANGES:
- Paras/Parasect and Breloom now learn False Swipe
- Blastoise is now Water/Steel type
- Hypno is now Psychic/Dark type with new ability "Nasty Surprise", which confuses poisoned foes
- Aggron is Steel/Dragon type
- Huntail is Water/Dragon type, Gorebyss is Water/Fairy type
(Note that most type changes also come with stat and moveset updates to match!)
- Wide Lens now found on Route 120 (replaces Net Ball near water near Fortree)

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed Player Pokémon being overlayed with player at end of battle (sorry about that!)
