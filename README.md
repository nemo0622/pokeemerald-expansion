## Bugs and Future Plans

### Known Bugs:
- Mugshots occasionally cut a little portion out of the textbox

### Future Plans:
- Expanded implementation of NPC Mugshot system
    - All trainers, maybe even all NPCs, should have mugshots when talking to them!
- HM System workaround - meet NPC's and Pokémon throughout your journey that you can call upon to help!
    - Ex: "Timburr's Timber" in Rustboro City will send helpful Timburr's to cut down trees for you
    - Code works, but need to add actual map locations!
- Slight tileset modifications (FRLG style trees, nicer grass?, etc.)
- Pokémon availability revamp - ~400 available species from generation 1-9
- NPC quests and more NPC "events" around Hoenn (ex: west of Petalburg, help out a stressed fisherman for a Rod)
- Story enhancements - make Aqua vs Magma conflict clearer + more interesting, bring elements of story improvements and Delta Episode from ORAS, etc.
- Hoopa Rings - mysterious rings found around Hoenn which transport one random Pokémon from another region
