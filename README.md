# Pokémon: Ecology Version

A Pokémon ROM Hack based on the [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) project.

## What is Pokémon: Ecology?

This ROM Hack takes place in a brand new region, with a whole new adventure ahead of you! By helping people and making an impact on this living, active region, you can rise through the ranks and become a great Pokémon Trainer.

Pokémon: Ecology Version is a ROM Hack coming from my love for real-world animals and ecosystems. After creating Pokémon Emerald Seaglass, I really wanted to continue my ROM Hacking journey, but I wanted to get more experimental and tie in my real world interests. As a Biology student in college, I have been constantly inspired by classes and what I've learned, and now I hope to apply this passion in a Pokémon game. I hope this experience helps people to think more about the environment around them! :)
